Input:
    - image paths -> send them to folder
    - folder ??
    - ask user to define nnunet paths -> import models

Native:
    - skull strip T1 and T2
    (????) - if not registered: register
    - compute MNI registration to T1
    - apply transformation of atlas to T1
    - crop following ROI
    - crop to model expected shape
    - add images to nnunet input folder for inference
    - apply model
    - return segmentation in original image

MNI:
    - skull strip T1 and T2
    (????) - if not registered: register 
    - compute T1 registration to MNI
    - apply transformation to T1 and T2
    - crop to ROI shape
    - add images to nnunet input folder for inference
    - apply model
    - return segmentation and images in MNI
    - apply inverse transform to segmentation
    - return segmentation in original image
